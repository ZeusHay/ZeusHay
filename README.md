- ðŸŒ± Currently my study goal is Python.
- ðŸ’¬ About me? I have been studying programming for about 5 years, my first contact with programming was with Visual Basic .net, my second contact was with C#, my third contact was with Lua, then Python and JavaScript, however, the one that I liked the most was Python for the simplicity and automation that it is able to achieve.
